# Frontend Developer Test

## Getting Started

1. Install Gulp globally (if not already installed on your system) - `npm install -g gulp`
2. Install all npm packages
3. Start coding! :)


## Objectives

The primary objective of the test is to convert the "broken" static site into a functioning Responsive web page. There is no PSD, you should use your best judgement to realign the site to be device agnostic.

In addition to the primary objective, you should aim to address one or more of the following objectives (in no particular order):

* __Acccessibility__ - improve the general Acccessibility of the page being sure to fix any *critical* issues
* __Semantics__ - improve the semantics of the HTML.
* __Performance__ - optimise the page for performance as best as you can.
* __Responsive Images__ - implement any Responsive Image solution you deem suitable.
* __CSS Structure and Optimisation:__
  * make any changes necessary to optimise CSS selectors
  * remove duplication from the CSS

## Extra Credit ;)

If you have extra time, consider implementing enhancements such as animations, event-driven effects, or custom web fonts.
